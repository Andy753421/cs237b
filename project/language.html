			Language basics
			  - Basics
			  - Control structures
			  - Functions
			  - Compound Types
		-->
		<p>
			The "Inside" language was first implemented in
			JavaScript using Ohm and a simple interpreter similar
			to the interpreters for the first few assignments from
			CS278A.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			This page serves mostly as a reference for the syntax
			and semantics of the interpreter. All examples are
			editable and updated in real time with the console
			output shown at the right and the return value (if not
			empty) shown at the end following a <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>
			marker.
		</p>

		<h3>Basics</h3>
		<p>
			Simple programs begin with a sequence of statements
			that are executed in order and terminated with
			semicolons.  Comments are added using the hash
			(<tt>#</tt>) character.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			# Hello, World
			print "hello, world";
			print "three:" (1+2);
			pi*10^2;
		</script>

		<h3>Assignment</h3>
		<p>
			Variables are assigned using the <tt>set</tt> keyword. <br />
			Only a single variable is supported per <tt>set</tt>.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set a = 1;
			set b = 2;
			print "three:" (a+b);
		</script>

		<h3>Grouping</h3>
		<p>
			Parenthesis are used override order of operations and
			group expressions. Sequences of expressions can be
			written using curly braces. Inside curly braces
			expression must be semicolon terminated and the last
			expression is used as the return value for the group.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set a =  1 + 2   * 3;
			set b = (1 + 2)  * 3;
			set c = {1 + 2;} * 3;
			print {
				"Yikes!";
				a+", "+b+", "+c;
			};
		</script>

		<h3>Control Structures</h3>
		<p>
			OCaml-like matching is supported.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			match 1 with
				| 1 -> "one"
				| 2 -> "two"
				| 3 -> "three"
				| _ -> "my head hurts";
		</script>
		<p>
			C-like if and else. Note that if/then/else is a single
			expression so the semicolon is only needed at the every
			end.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			if (1 < 2)
				print "Well, math works"
			else
				print "Oh no!";
		</script>
		<p>
			While loops in the interpreter are more efficient than
			recursion because tail calls are not supported.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set i = 1;
			set f = 1;
			while (i < 10) {
				set f = f * i;
				set i = i + 1;
			};
			print "!" i "=" f;
		</script>

		<h3>Functions</h3>
		<p>
			Anonymous functions can be assigned to variables.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set hello = fun first last ->
				print "Hello," first last;

			hello "Andy" "Spencer";
		</script>
		<p>
			Shorthand <tt>def</tt> notation is implemented as syntax
			sugar on top of <tt>set</tt> and <tt>fun</tt>.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			def goodbye first last:
				print "Goodbye," first last;

			goodbye "Andy" "Spencer";
		</script>
		<p>
			A second <tt>as</tt> notation can be useful when passing a
			function as an argument.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			def foreach list fcn: {
				fcn list.0;
				fcn list.1;
			};

			foreach [ "Andy", "Spencer" ] as name:
				print name;
		</script>
		<p>
			All types of functions are closures and local
			variables.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set first  = "Andy";
			set last   = "Spencer";
			set hiandy = fun ->
				print "Hello," first last;
			hiandy();
			(fun f -> f()) hiandy;
		</script>
		<p>
			Recursion is supported, but is not particularly
			efficient.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			def fact n:
				match n with
					| 1 -> 1
					| _ -> n * fact (n-1);
			print "!3" "=" (fact 3);
			print "!5" "=" (fact 5);
		</script>

		<h3>Compound Types</h3>
		<p>
			Lists are defined with square braces and accessed with
			the dot (<tt>.</tt>) operator. Expressions can be used
			as indexes if they are surrounded by parenthesis.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set me = [ "Andy", "Spencer" ];
			print me.0 me.1;
			print me.0 me.(2-1);
		</script>

		<p>
			Records (associative arrays, or dictionaries, or objects)
			are very similar to lists but use strings as indexes.
			Note that unlike JavaScript, square braces are used for
			both lists and records.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set me = [ first: "Andy",
			           last:  "Spencer" ];
			print me.first me.last;
			print me.first me.("last");
		</script>

		<p>
			"Tagged" types similar to OCaml are also supported.
			This is currently weakly implemented as a conversion to
			a list.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set me = Person "Andy" "Spencer";
			match me with
				| Person first last ->
					print first last;
			print me.0 me.1 me.2;
		</script>
