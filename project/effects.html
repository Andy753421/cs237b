			Side Effects
			  - Assignment
			  - Functions
			  - State
		-->
		<p>
			While most of the language is very similar to other
			languages, the way side effects are handled is
			slightly different in a number of ways. This page
			describes the semantics of variable references and some
			ways they can be used.
		</p>
		<h3>Assignment</h3>
		<p>
			With inline code, variables can be mutated at will and
			compound types and closures are treated as references.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set one   = 1;
			set lst   = ["zero", "one", "two"];

			set one   = 2;
			set lst.2 = "five";

			print "one" "=" one;
			print "two" "=" lst.2;
		</script>

		<h3>Functions</h3>
		<p>
			However, within functions variables are cloned and
			cannot in any way effect the caller of the function.
			This is implemented as call-by-value with a deep copy
			on every parameter. In addition, the environment is
			cloned when a closure is created. Closures passed as
			arguments are also deeply copied.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set one = 1;
			set lst = ["zero", "one", "two"];

			def update: {
				set one   = 2;
				set lst.2 = "five";
			};
			update();

			print "one" "=" one;
			print "two" "=" lst.2;
		</script>

		<h3>State</h3>
		<p>
			Within a function, state is maintained between calls.
			This allows for the creation of iterator functions, or
			stateful functions such as counters, filters, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			A simple counter function, separate copies of <tt>n</tt>
			are stored for the <tt>inc</tt> closure and the
			enclosing scope.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set n = 0;
			def inc:
				set n = n+1;
			print "n =" n "and" inc();
			print "n =" n "and" inc();
		</script>

		<p>
			State is not kept if the closure is passed as an
			argument because all arguments are call-by-value.
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			set n = 0;
			def inc:
				set n = n+1;
			def call func:
				print "n =" func();
			call inc;
			call inc;
		</script>

		<p>
			A counter factory function
		</p>
		<script class="split" src="src/main.js">
			def ctr n:
				fun -> set n = n + 1;
			set c1 = ctr 10;
			set c2 = ctr 20;

			print "c1:" c1() "->" c1() "->" c1();
			print "c2:" c2() "->" c2() "->" c2();
		</script>
