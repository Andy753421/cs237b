I need to think of some examples for the second draft, I envision the tagging
and views implemented though and IDE or tool so there's no special syntax for
specifying a tag, otherwise things will get out of sync too easily. I think it
could be applied to a wide range of languages, but maybe something like object
oriented languages would be the most useful.

Say that the programer manually tags lines of code, GUI assisted.
